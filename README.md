## INTRODUCTION
   
Biomedical information is becoming increasingly easier to obtain thanks to wearable technology and cheaper devices. However, it’s really hard to keep up with all the software that comes with each single equipment because each of them is incompatible with all others.

We aim at building a **framework capable of reading, analysing and displaying the information from any compatible biomedical device**. At first it’ll work with the EEG systems [Emotiv EPOC](https://emotiv.com/epoc.php) and [Neurosky Mindset](http://neurosky.com/biosensors/eeg-sensor/biosensors/), but it’ll be expansible so that more devices and functionalities can be easily added in the future.

The framework, **BrainLight**, will be the foundation upon which countless applications that use biosignals can be developed, but it will still be an end-user solution since it’ll also have a graphic interface showing all the information it’s receiving and analysing. To validate BrainLight’s usability we’ll also develop a proof of concept that employs the framework’s functionalities. It will consist on a web app on which a physician can check the real-time and past signals of a patient, enabling long-distance consultations.
